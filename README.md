    Keyword or phrase. Eg: find all articles containing the word 'Microsoft'.
    Date published. Eg: find all articles published yesterday.
    Source domain name. Eg: find all articles published on thenextweb.com.
    Language. Eg: find all articles written in English.
    You can sort the results in the following orders:

    Date published
    Relevancy to search keyword
